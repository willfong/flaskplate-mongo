# Flaskplate - Boilerplate for Python/Flask + MongoDB

Technology should make our lives easier.


## The problem

There should be a way to get app ideas from our heads into a web site quickly. From there, the app can be tested and improved. Stop planning, and start implementing and iterating!


## The goal

Flaskplate is for putting ideas onto a web application easily and quickly without needing to be a full-time programmer.

It is very important to understand all the code being used, but there is also a balance of not needing to be fully fluent in a programming language before one can start making some progress and output.

Let's get the code down first and put something onto the screen. Learn about the parts that we will use all the time first, so we can get our ideas out. Learn later about the parts that is used less frequently.


## Why Flaskplate

Flaskplate uses the Python programming language because it is clean and easy to read. Python is also easily available on most platforms.

Flaskplate uses the Python web framework Flask. It is a minimal framework that handles the backend web site stuff. We wanted to use a minimal framework so you spend less time debugging the framework and more time putting logic into your application.


## Who this is for

Non-programmers
CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) ideas


## Requirements




## Set up

macOS & Linux
```
virtualenv venv
. venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "from app import init_db; init_db()"
FLASK_APP=app.py FLASK_DEBUG=1 flask run
```

Windows
```
virtualenv venv
venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
python -c "from app import init_db; init_db()"
SET FLASK_APP=app.py
SET FLASK_DEBUG=1
flask run
```

By default, Flask will only listen to connections on your computer. This is for security. To allow other devices to connect to your computer, run `flask run --host=0.0.0.0` instead of `flask run`.
